(BAM_INCLUDE, BAM_LIB) to point to the corresponding locations for samtools

To install and run CLASS, you will need to download and
install several packages:

0.1)  samtools
Performs managment of large short read alignment files. Freely
available from Sourceforge: http://samtools.sourceforge.net .

0.2)  lpsolve
Is a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solver. A copy of the
software is already included with this package (subdirectory lp_solve_5.5)
and will be compiled when running build.sh. It is also freely available
from Sourceforge: http://sourceforge.net/projects/lpsolve/. Version
should be no less than 5.5.

IMPORTANT: lpsolve and samtools have a duplicated variable name, you need to
	   change the name if you plan to build lpsolve yourself from
           independent source code.
